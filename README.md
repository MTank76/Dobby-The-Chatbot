# Dobby The-Chatbot

Dobby Chatbot is a conversational agent developed as a hobby project while exploring Python's NLTK library. Built using the `nltk.chat.util` module with `Chat` and `reflections`, this chatbot simulates a conversation with users based on predefined patterns and responses.

## Project Overview

Dobby The-Chatbot offers the following features:

- **Conversational Interaction:** Engages users in conversation based on predefined patterns and responses.
- **Python and NLTK Implementation:** Utilizes Python programming language and the NLTK library to create the chatbot.
- **Jupyter Notebook Integration:** Developed and tested within a Jupyter Notebook environment for interactive learning and experimentation.

## Development Details

- **Python Implementation:** The chatbot logic is implemented using Python, employing NLTK's `Chat` and `reflections` utilities.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The development, testing, and exploration of Dobby Chatbot were conducted within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- **NLTK Library:** Utilizes NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to facilitate text processing and pattern matching for the chatbot's responses.
